## Hints
1. You do not have to-and should not-generate all permutations. This would be very
   inefficient.
2. What characteristics would a string that is a permutation of a palindrome have?
3. Have you tried a hash table? You should be able to get this down to 0 (N) time.
4. Can you reduce the space usage by using a bit vector?
